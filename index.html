  Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
  Remember me to one who lives there
   She once was a true love of mine
  Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
      ( in the deep forest green )
  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
       ( Tracing of sparrow on )
       (  snow-crested ground  )
   Without no seams nor needle work
       ( Bedclothes the child  )
       (    of the mountain    )
   Then she'll be a true love of mine
( Sleeps unaware of the clarion call )
  Tell her to find me an acre of land
      ( A sprinkling of leaves )
   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
 (Washes the grave with silvery tears)
        Between the salt water
         and the sea strands
        ( And polishes a gun )
  Then she'll be a true love of mine
       Tell her to reap it with
         a sickle of leather
   ( Blazing in scarlet battalions )
  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
      (     Generals order     )
      ( their soldiers to kill )
           And gather it all
         in a bunch of heather
     (          A cause           )
     ( they've long ago forgotten )
  Then she'll be a true love of mine
  Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
  Remember me to one who lives there
   She once was a true love of mine
